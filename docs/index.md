# Special Thanks
Eugene - Overall support and ideas for new features, a lot of Nitro Studio's conviences are because of him.
Gericom - For generously allowing me to use some of his tools for SSEQ playback and IMA-ADPCM encoding. He also helped me understand how parts of the stream works.
RoadrunnerWMC - For taking the time to answer some of my questions about the SDAT, giving me a pretty solid understanding of jow things work.
