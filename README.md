# NitroTools
Some tools for Nitro Sound Data (SDAT)

[Nitro Studio Download](https://gota7.github.io/NitroTools/) 

## Included Tools
* SymbTool - An extractor and packer for symb.bin filenames.
* InfoTool - An extractor and packer for info.bin track info.
* NitroFileLoader (With Structures) - Tools that allow you to load info and symb files to more editable formats, and convert them back correctly.
* Nitro Studio - GUI editor for sdats.

## Known Bugs
* SymbTool should work assuming there are no SeqArc placeholders. There usually is not.
* SymbTool will not work with NSMBDS, since it was coded badly.
* Nitro Studio is not complete!

## Special Thanks
* Eugene - Overall support and ideas for new features, a lot of Nitro Studio's conviences are because of him.
* Gericom - For generously allowing me to use some of his tools for SSEQ playback and IMA-ADPCM encoding. He also helped me understand how parts of the stream works.
* RoadrunnerWMC - For taking the time to answer some of my questions about the SDAT, giving me a pretty solid understanding of jow things work.
