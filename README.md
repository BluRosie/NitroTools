# NitroTools
Some tools for Nitro Sound Data (SDAT)

## Included Tools
* SymbTool - An extractor and packer for symb.bin filenames.
* InfoTool - An extractor and packer for info.bin track info.
* NitroFileLoader (With Structures) - Tools that allow you to load info and symb files to more editable formats, and convert them back correctly.

## Planned Tools
* Nitro Studio - GUI editor for extracted sdats.

## Known Bugs
* SymbTool should work assuming there are no SeqArc placeholders. There usually is not.
* SymbTool will not work with NSMBDS, since it was coded badly.
