# NitroTools
Some tools for Nitro Sound Data (SDAT)

## Included Tools
* SymbTool - An extractor and packer for symb.bin filenames.
* InfoTool - An extractor and packer for info.bin track info.

## Planned Tools
* Nitro Studio - GUI editor for extracted sdats.
* Add File Data - A quick way to append new songs to the info and symb.

## Known Bugs
* SymbTool will always ignore placeholders, as they are not important. However, this removes DS Sound Studio compatibility.
* InfoTool CAN'T read placeholders in the groups, so pray your info.bin doesn't have them, which usually is the case.
